    "Derivatives are ubiquitous in many fields such as engineering design optimization, fluid dynamics and machine learning.\n",
    "There are in general three ways to calculate the derivatives: automatic differentiation, numeric differentiation, and\n",
    "symbolic differentiation. Automatic Differentiation (AD) brings a family of techniques that can calculate the partial\n",
    "derivatives of any function at any point efficiently and accurately. Unlike numeric differentiation, AD does not have\n",
    "the problem of floating point precision errors, since it calculates the derivative of a simple function, and keeps track of\n",
    "these derivatives, and there is no need of step sizes. Compared to symbolic differentiation, AD is not as memory intense,\n",
    "and can be much faster in terms of the calculation. Therefore, AD is an important way to calculate derivatives in\n",
    "practice.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of Automatic Differentiation is the principle that functions implemented as computer code can be broken down into elementary functions, ranging from arithmetic operations (e.g. addition, subtraction etc.) and other functions (e.g. power, exponential, sin etc.). Hence, any differentiable function can be interpreted as a composition of different functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given a function, $f = sin^2(2x)$, it can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f = \\phi_1(\\phi_2(\\phi_3(x))) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $$ \\phi_1(z) = z^2,   \\phi_2(y) = sin(y) \\text{ and } \\phi_3(x) = 2x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the forward mode, the chain rule can then be applied successively to each elementary component function to obtain the derivative of the function. Using the same example above, let $c$ be a real number:\n",
    "$$ f'(c) =  \\phi_3'(\\phi_2(\\phi_1(c))) \\cdot \\phi_2'(\\phi_1(c)) \\cdot \\phi_1'(c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the example above, the derivative, $f'(c)$, can be evaluated based on the following function-derivative pairs at each stage of computing the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\phi_1(c), \\phi_1'(c))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\phi_2(\\phi_1(c)), (\\phi_2'(\\phi_1(c)) \\cdot \\phi_1'(c)))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\phi_3(\\phi_2(\\phi_1(c))), \\phi_3'(\\phi_2(\\phi_1(c)) \\cdot \\phi_2'(\\phi_1(c)) \\cdot \\phi_1'(c))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, the forward mode computes the Jacobian-vector product, $Jp$. This decomposition can be represented via a computational graph structure of calculations, requiring initial values to be set for $x_1$, and $x'_1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_1 \\rightarrow^{\\phi_3(x)} x_2 \\rightarrow^{\\phi_2(x)} x_3 \\rightarrow^{\\phi_1(x)} y $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $$ \\phi_1(x) = x^2,   \\phi_2(x) = sin(x) \\text{ and } \\phi_3(x) = 2x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At each stage of the function, the derivative of the function with respect to its argument is calculated. The exact values of the function and its derivative are used for the following function-derivative pair of values. An example of the computational trace for the equation $f = sin^2(2x)$ would look like this, for $x = \\dfrac{\\pi}{6}$. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "By evaluating the derivative at each step of the chain rule, we eventually obtain the value of the derivative $f'(x) = \\sqrt{3}$ at $x = \\dfrac{\\pi}{6}$, as second entry of the final tuple in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above illustrates the forward mode of AD (the focus of our package), AD also has a reverse mode. Without using chain rule, it first does a forward pass to store the partial derivatives, before undertaking a reverse pass, which starts from the final function to be differentiated, $y$. After fixing the derivative of the final function, it then computes the derivative of each component function with respect to its parent function recursively (using chain rule) until the derivative of the function with respect to the basic-level argument (e.g. $x_1$) can be calculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of efficiency, the forward mode is more efficient when the number of functions to evaluate is much greater than the number of inputs, whereas the reverse mode, which computes the Jacobian-transpose-vector-product is more efficient when the number of inputs is much greater than the number of functions."

    "Our next steps will be to implement the reverse mode of Automatic Differentiation. The main challenge for this is to translate the conceptual framework of reverse mode into functioning code that builds on existing code. This might require creating a new class specifically for the reverse mode that replicates similar functions already in the existing `Ad_Var`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Building on our implementation of reverse mode of Auto Differentiation, a future feature that we plan to implement would be a feature that automatically chooses between the forward mode or reverse mode of Automatic Differentiation, based on what is optimal based on the number of parameters and functions. This will be presented to the user of the package to facilitate their decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the forward mode of Auto Differentiation, we will work on refining the `get_jacobian` method that would return the Jacobian matrix for an array of `Ad_Var` objects. This will allow the user to access the Jacobian via the `Ad_Var` class. We will also include doc-strings for the code, so ensure that the code is accessible to the user."
