    "Derivatives are ubiquitous in many fields such as engineering design optimization, fluid dynamics and machine learning.\n",
    "There are in general three ways to calculate the derivatives: automatic differentiation, numeric differentiation, and\n",
    "symbolic differentiation. Automatic Differentiation (AD) brings a family of techniques that can calculate the partial\n",
    "derivatives of any function at any point efficiently and accurately. Unlike numeric differentiation, AD does not have\n",
    "the problem of floating point precision errors, since it calculates the derivative of a simple function, and keeps track of\n",
    "these derivatives, and there is no need of step sizes. Compared to symbolic differentiation, AD is not as memory intense,\n",
    "and can be much faster in terms of the calculation. Therefore, AD is an important way to calculate derivatives in\n",
    "practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two modes in Automatic Differentiation: forward mode and the reverse mode. In forward mode, the chain rule is applied to each basic operation, and both the variable's value and derivative are calculated along the way, leading to a complete derivative trace. In reverse mode, there is a forward phase, where the intermediate variables are computed and their values and partial derivatives with respect to the previous layer stored in the memory, and also a backward phase, where we propagate back the derivatives with the help of the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software that we design calculates the derivatives given the userâ€™s input using the forward mode/reverse mode of automatic differentiation depending on the user's choice,\n",
    "and provides the user with an easy way to solve their optimization problem using derivatives.\n"

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of Automatic Differentiation is the principle that functions implemented as computer code can be broken down into elementary functions, ranging from arithmetic operations (e.g. addition, subtraction etc.) and other functions (e.g. power, exponential, sin etc.). Hence, any differentiable function can be interpreted as a composition of different functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given a function, $f = sin^2(2x)$, it can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f = \\phi_1(\\phi_2(\\phi_3(x))) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $$ \\phi_1(z) = z^2,   \\phi_2(y) = sin(y) \\text{ and } \\phi_3(x) = 2x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the forward mode, the chain rule can then be applied successively to each elementary component function to obtain the derivative of the function. Using the same example above, let $c$ be a real number:\n",
    "$$ f'(c) =  \\phi_3'(\\phi_2(\\phi_1(c))) \\cdot \\phi_2'(\\phi_1(c)) \\cdot \\phi_1'(c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the example above, the derivative, $f'(c)$, can be evaluated based on the following function-derivative pairs at each stage of computing the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\phi_1(c), \\phi_1'(c))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\phi_2(\\phi_1(c)), (\\phi_2'(\\phi_1(c)) \\cdot \\phi_1'(c)))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\phi_3(\\phi_2(\\phi_1(c))), \\phi_3'(\\phi_2(\\phi_1(c)) \\cdot \\phi_2'(\\phi_1(c)) \\cdot \\phi_1'(c))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, the forward mode computes the Jacobian-vector product, $Jp$. This decomposition can be represented via a computational graph structure of calculations, requiring initial values to be set for $x_1$, and $x'_1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_1 \\rightarrow^{\\phi_3(x)} x_2 \\rightarrow^{\\phi_2(x)} x_3 \\rightarrow^{\\phi_1(x)} y $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $$ \\phi_1(x) = x^2,   \\phi_2(x) = sin(x) \\text{ and } \\phi_3(x) = 2x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At each stage of the function, the derivative of the function with respect to its argument is calculated. The exact values of the function and its derivative are used for the following function-derivative pair of values. An example of the computational trace for the equation $f = sin^2(2x)$ would look like this, for $x = \\dfrac{\\pi}{6}$. \n",

    "By evaluating the derivative at each step of the chain rule, we eventually obtain the value of the derivative $f'(x) = \\sqrt{3}$ at $x = \\dfrac{\\pi}{6}$, as second entry of the final tuple in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above illustrates the forward mode of AD (the focus of our package), AD also has a reverse mode. Without using chain rule, it first does a forward pass to store the partial derivatives, before undertaking a reverse pass, which starts from the final function to be differentiated, $y$. After fixing the derivative of the final function, it then computes the derivative of each component function with respect to its parent function recursively (using chain rule) until the derivative of the function with respect to the basic-level argument (e.g. $x_1$) can be calculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of efficiency, the forward mode is more efficient when the number of functions to evaluate is much greater than the number of inputs, whereas the reverse mode, which computes the Jacobian-transpose-vector-product is more efficient when the number of inputs is much greater than the number of functions."

    "### Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary module will be a single `AutoDiff.py` file. Contained within will be the definition for an `Ad_Var` class. Instances of this class, through interaction with other `Ad_Var` objects, will be able to compute the value of a function as well as the value of that function's derivative with respect to any input variable. At present, we envision that this module will be powerful enough to handle forward differentiation of any function comprised of the following elementary functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fundamental arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)\n",
    "* Logarithm (of any base)\n",
    "* Negation\n",
    "* Exponentiation ($e^x$ for an `Ad_Var` instance $x$)\n",
    "* Power and root functions ($x^n$ for some real $n$)\n",
    "* Trigonometric functions ($\\sin(x)$, $\\cos(x)$, $\\tan(x)$)\n",
    "* Inverse trigonometric functions ($\\arcsin(x)$, $\\arccos(x)$, $\\arctan(x)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on our eventual choice for the \"additional\" feature of this project, or future design decisions, there\n",
    "may be additional modules added in the future that supplement or subdivide the functionality of `AutoDiff.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance of the `Ad_Var` class in the `AutoDiff` package represents the definition of a set of variables at a particular evaluation point. Through manipulations of these instances (either through fundamental arithmetic operations or built-in methods representing additional elementary functions described earlier), a user has the capability of representing any continuous differentiable function, be it scalar or vector. This was shown earlier via a code demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing and Coverage\n",
    "In the `test` folder, there will be a separate Python module `test_autodiff.py`, which will be the test-suite for `AutoDiff.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The test-suite will contain tests for the methods in the `Ad_Var` class, to ensure that the elementary functions return the desired output. Tests are run using pytest. The tests are linked to Travis CI and CodeCov, which will manage continuous integration and code coverage respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation and distribution of package\n",
    "At this milestone, the recommended method to access the package is to download or clone the package's Github repo (https://github.com/the-differentiators/cs207-FinalProject.git). The user must ensure that the package's requirements (`numpy`) are installed, or install them manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the final submission, we intend to distribute the package via PyPI. There will be no additional packaging framework included; we believe the scope of this project can be contained within a relatively simple directory structure with few functional python files and should not require additional overhead for users to install and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package will be available on PyPI and the user will be able to install the package in the standard way using `pip`. We will also provide a `yml` file which will be used by the user to create the appropriate environment and ensure that dependencies like `numpy` have been installed. Then, to use the package, the user will only need to import our package which will implicitly import any other packages used by `AutoDiff`."
